GAME MECHANICS
Primary Mechanic: Fixed-axis PvE-style fighting game
Game contains 1 level that is identical on all iterations.
Player moves (controls undefined) from one edge of the screen to the other edge, which acts as the "goal."
(5) enemies (club's bouncers) act as inhibitors to the player's progress.
DISCUSSION POINT: How do they block the player? constantly move towards him (easier)? or actually attacking the player (harder)?
If they attack the player the player must have a health status, which introduces a "lose" condition that would not grant the player any points.
Player strings together attack combos (controls undefined) to defeat the bouncers in increasingly flamboyant ways.
DISCUSSION POINT: What control scheme do we want? WASD+others with mouse for menu interaction?  
DISCUSSION POINT: What kind of attack types do we want to include? Light/Heavy? Lift/Crush?
DISCUSSION POINT: Do special moves have their own button/buttons or are they activated through specific attack-type combos?
Player has the option of just jumping over the guards, but gaining very little points for this. (May be useful for first couple levels?)
Secret areas of the level are only accessible through specific actions or unlocked abilities.
Secondary Mechanic: Additional content is unlocked through consecutive plays.
Player gains points through use of increasingly advanced abilities and the player's own skill.
Points can be used at the end of each "level" to buy new/more effective abilities.
DISCUSSION POINT: We need to work out a full list of unlocks.
Player begins with only the ability to strike (once) at a time and single-jump.
Balancing unlock progression is going to be critically important, players should never feel as if the next unlock would require them to "grind."
DISCUSSION POINT: Should unlocks be in non-restrictive trees (you can jump between trees without prerequisites) or restrictive ones?  Either way we need to think of at least two trees of unlocks that have different effects.
